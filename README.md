# Towards Better Understanding Network Visualizations: Using an Immersive Virtual Reality Approach
My final project for CS 347 (Human-Computer Interaction Research) explored whether differences in learning effectiveness (operationalized as user learning motivation and learning outcome) exist with regard to using either immersive or desktop VR to explore a VR network visualization application called VRNetzer. This work investigates how immersive VR technology can support and enhance usersâ€™ understanding of complex networks with a randomized, between-subjects experiment with 33 participants.

Participants in the immersive VR condition were found to experience significantly more learning motivation, and they outperformed their counterparts in the desktop condition on a learning assessment. Learning motivation was also found to mediate the effect of participant condition on learning outcome.
